#Interior_Design

An old site I made back when I was learning SCSS and RWD(it was a group project and had more sections and a footer
but here I upload only sections made by myself, which is why it ends with the slider). It is responsive,
the general layout is based on bootstrap's grid, flex is used for lower level layout. Also clicking on slider
pictures opens up a picture album, which can be thought of as another section.

I used vanilla JS Gulp for SCSS compilation.



Graphical design is based on http://adoringinteiordesingn.info/
